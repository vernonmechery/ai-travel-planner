# Ai Travel Planner Crew

Welcome to the AI Travel Planner Crew project. 

Here we are building an AI app which creates a Travel itinerary based on the input from the user. For example, if the user input is Sydney, Australia, the AI app would give the user an itinerary for Sydney, Australia as a response. The app uses LLM's via AWS bedrock and AWS bedrock agentcore runtime services under the hood.

In section (1. CrewAI Installation and Run Guide), we install the dependencies. We are using CrewAI which is an open source platform to build AI app. It uses agents and tasks defined in config/agents.yaml and config/tasks.yaml to achieve the objectives.

In section (2. AgentCore Installation and Run Guide), we are using the same AI app but running it as a docker container hosted on AWS agentcode runtime service. Then we expose the endpoints using AWS lambda and API Gateway. Finally connect app to Streamlit UI for accessing the endpoint.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/ai_travel_planner/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/ai_travel_planner/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/ai_travel_planner/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/ai_travel_planner/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the ai_travel_planner Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run and create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The ai_travel_planner Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve it's objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
